      I've gotten used to sharing the interesting things I find in life with you
      first. 💌
    </p>
    <p>
      After carefully considering what you just said to me, I have realized the
      reason, and it is indeed my fault. I sincerely apologize to you, and I
      will not beat around the bush anymore. So, I hope you forgive me. 🙏 I
      promise you that we will go back to how things were before, because you
      know I am genuinely good to you. I always patiently watch every word or
      video you send me, and whenever you are sad or angry, I can catch your
      emotions and in the end, I will comfort you. 🤗
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, I was terribly wrong because my intention was to make you happy,
      but my constant beating around the bush made you annoyed, which went
      against my original intention. So, I have figured it out, and I will not
      do this anymore because this is the first time I have liked a girl so
      much, and I have no experience in pursuing. No one is perfect, and I will
      make mistakes, but I will solve this problem. So, Rayan, let's go back to
      the way things were (we have known each other for half a year, and time
      flies). ⏳
    </p>
    <p>
      (I am very sorry for saying that you did not thank me because I did not
      hear clearly what you said in the voice message and misunderstood you, so
      I apologize for that.) 😔 I think I am a very sincere person to you, so I
      hope you will give me the opportunity to continue to make you happy. 😊
