    <p>Dear TalaðŸŒ¸ðŸŒ¸:</p>
    <p>
      If you see this message, it means I have already left. I understand that
      on HelloTalk, you have many chat partners, and I understand and support
      your approach. After all, you just want to make friends, which is also the
      original intention of this application. However, I cannot tolerate
      watching you chat with a boy who has marital intentions towards you every
      day and laughing endlesslyðŸ˜£.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Chinese concept of love, there is a classic saying: If you love
      someone, you must give them enough sense of security. That's also why I
      modified my personal introduction, shared updates about you, and even
      ignored any girls (including Chinese girls). Of course, I don't want to
      force you to do this because we have talked about cultural differences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you know why I made you make that promise? If someone keeps attacking ,
      then there seems to be no invincible fortress in the world. I understand
      this because I have also experienced it myself. However, watching you chat
      with that Chinese man every day makes me wonder if your love for me is a
      deep affection between friends, a passionate love between lovers, or if
      you just pity me and don't want to make me sad. Whenever I think of these,
      the pain in my heart cannot be expressedðŸ’”, because I love you deeply.
      Therefore, I have decided to leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      I choose to bid farewell in this way, rather than facing you directly,
      because I am not sure if you will open this website again. I just want to
      leave beautiful memories between us on HelloTalk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, I want to tell you again that I love you. You are the kindest
      person I have ever met, and I really can't bear to part with you. But I
      feel that I can no longer tolerate such pain. I hope you will be happy in
      the future and I will also be happy for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      You once said that love is something about the spirit, so my spirit will
      always be with you. If you need my help in the future, you can contact me
      through my WeChat account. My WeChat ID is ian1998miao.
