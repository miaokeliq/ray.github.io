        I've gotten used to sharing the interesting things I find in life with
        you first. 💌
      </p>
      <p>
        After carefully considering what you just said to me, I have realized
        the reason, and it is indeed my fault. I sincerely apologize to you, and
        I will not beat around the bush anymore. So, I hope you forgive me. 🙏 I
        promise you that we will go back to how things were before, because you
        know I am genuinely good to you. I always patiently watch every word or
        video you send me, and whenever you are sad or angry, I can catch your
        emotions and in the end, I will comfort you. 🤗
      </p>
      <p>
        In short, I was terribly wrong because my intention was to make you
        happy, but my constant beating around the bush made you annoyed, which
        went against my original intention. So, I have figured it out, and I
        will not do this anymore because this is the first time I have liked a
        girl so much, and I have no experience in pursuing. No one is perfect,
        and I will make mistakes, but I will solve this problem. So, Rayan,
        let's go back to the way things were (we have known each other for half
        a year, and time flies). ⏳
      </p>
      <p>
        (I am very sorry for saying that you did not thank me because I did not
        hear clearly what you said in the voice message and misunderstood you,
        so I apologize for that.) 😔 I think I am a very sincere person to you,
        so I hope you will give me the opportunity to continue to make you
        happy. 😊
